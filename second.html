        <h4>Facebook</h4>
        <p>
            Zuckerberg built a website called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending Harvard University. The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used "photos compiled from the online face books of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the "hotter" person".[18] Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours.[19] The site was sent to several campus group listservs, but was shut down a few days later by Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged with breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.[18] Zuckerberg expanded on this project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an art history final exam. He uploaded all art images to a website, each of which was accompanied by a comments section, then shared the site with his classmates.[20]

A "face book" is a student directory featuring photos and personal information.[19] In 2003, Harvard had only a paper version[21] along with private online directories.[18][22] Zuckerberg told The Harvard Crimson, "Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard. ... I think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week."[22] In January 2004, Zuckerberg coded a new website, known as "TheFacebook", inspired by a Crimson editorial about Facemash, stating, "It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available ... the benefits are many." Zuckerberg met with Harvard student Eduardo Saverin, and each of them agreed to invest $1,000 in the site.[23] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "TheFacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.[24]

Cable News Network (CNN) is an American news-based pay television channel owned by CNN Worldwide, a unit of the WarnerMedia News & Sports division of AT&T's WarnerMedia.[2] It was founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner and Reese Schonfeld as a 24-hour cable news channel.[3][4][5] Upon its launch in 1980, CNN was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage,[6] and was the first all-news television channel in the United States.[7]

While the news channel has numerous affiliates, CNN primarily broadcasts from WarnerMedia's headquarters at 30 Hudson Yards in New York City, and studios in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. The CNN Center in Atlanta is only used for weekend programming. CNN is sometimes referred to as CNN/U.S. (or CNN Domestic)[8] to distinguish the U.S. channel from its international sister network, CNN International.

The network is known for its dramatic live coverage of breaking news, some of which has drawn criticism as overly sensationalistic.[9] The network has also been criticized for its efforts to be nonpartisan, which have led to accusations of false balance.[10][11][12]

As of September 2018, CNN has 90.1 million television households as subscribers (97.7% of households with cable) in the United States.[13] In 2019, CNN ranked third in viewership among cable news networks, behind Fox News and MSNBC, averaging 972,000 viewers.[14] CNN ranks 14th among all basic cable networks.[15][16]

Globally, CNN programming airs through CNN International, which can be seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories.[17] The US domestic version, sometimes referred to as CNN (US) is also available in Canada, some islands of the Caribbean and in Japan, where it was first broadcast on CNNj in 2003, with simultaneous translation in Japanese.[18]

        Did you know that Python wasn’t originally built for Data Science? And yet today it’s one of the best languages for statistics, machine learning, and predictive analytics as well as simple data analytics tasks. How come? It’s an open-source language, and data professionals started creating tools for it to complete data tasks more efficiently. Here, I’ll introduce the most important Python libraries and packages that you have to know as a Data Scientist.

        In my previous article, I introduced the Python import statement and the most important modules from the Python Standard Library. In this one, I’ll focus on the libraries and packages that are not coming with Python 3 by default. At the end of the article, I’ll also show you how to get (download, install and import) them.

        Numpy will help you to manage multi-dimensional arrays very efficiently. Maybe you won’t do that directly, but since the concept is a crucial part of data science, many other libraries (well, almost all of them) are built on Numpy. Simply put: without Numpy you won’t be able to use Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy or Scikit-Learn. That’s why you need it on the first hand.

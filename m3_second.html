        As it can be seen that the length (size) of the array above made is 9. But what if there is a requirement to change this length (size). For Example,

If there is a situation where only 5 elements are needed to be entered in this array. In this case, the remaining 4 indices are just wasting memory in this array. So there is a requirement to lessen the length (size) of the array from 9 to 5.
Take another situation. In this, there is an array of 9 elements with all 9 indices filled. But there is a need to enter 3 more elements in this array. In this case 3 indices more are required. So the length (size) of the array needs to be changed from 9 to 12.
